    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>A heritage language is a language that is passed down from generation to generation within a community, often within families or ethnic groups. It is an essential aspect of cultural identity, and it plays a very important role in maintaining cultural heritage.</p>
      <h2>Benefits of Heritage Language</h2>
      <p>Preserving heritage language strengthens cultural identity and fosters a sense of belonging within communities. Also, it strengthens cognitive abilities and promotes multilingualism, which has been linked to improved problem-solving skills and academic achievement. In addition, it opens doors to cultural understanding, communication, and opportunities in an increasingly interconnected world.</p>
